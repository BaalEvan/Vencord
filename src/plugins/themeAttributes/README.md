# ThemeAttributes

This plugin adds data attributes to various elements inside Discord

This allows themes to more easily theme those elements or even do things that otherwise wouldn't be possible

## Available Attributes

### All Tab Bars (User Settings, Server Settings, etc)

`data-tab-id` contains the id of that tab
